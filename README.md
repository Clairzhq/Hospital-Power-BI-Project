# Healthcare Dynamics -In Depth Analysis 

This Power BI project is designed to provide a comprehensive data visualization for healthcare. The primary objectives of this project is to offer interactive and insightful tools for hospital management team to track and analyze various aspects of patient visits, facility availability, revenue generated across different age groups, appointment, waiting time and feedback on medical prescriptions  and medical services.

The **Hospital Summary Dashboard** provides an overview of key hospital metrics, revealing a total of 2,506 patients, including 1,679 inpatients and 827 outpatients. The facility employs 262 staff members, resulting in a patient-to-staff ratio of 0.10. The average emergency room (ER) wait time is 47 minutes, and the average treatment cost is 161.41. Currently, 2,847 beds are occupied out of a total capacity of 5,694. Department-wise ER performance shows that OPD Outpatient has the highest average ER wait time at 94 minutes, followed by Gynaecology and Oncology (both at 55 minutes), whereas Physical Medicine reports the lowest at just 9 minutes.

Revenue generation is led by the 6–20 age group contributing 136K, followed by the 41–60 age group with 110K, and the 21–40 group with 77K. Patient sentiment is largely positive, with 95.61% of patients providing favorable feedback. Specifically, 1,828 patients fully agreed with positive feedback statements, while only a small portion expressed disagreement or uncertainty. Patient ratings are highest among the 6–20 age group (4.94/5) and gradually decrease with age, with the 60+ age group rating the lowest at 4.76, indicating a potential area for improving care experiences for older patients.


The **Patient Summary Dashboard** highlights key hospitalization metrics, showing a total of 2,506 patients, with 493 admitted, 209 discharged, 82 ICU admissions, and 86 deaths. The average length of stay (LOS) is 1.70 days. Gender distribution is almost equal, with 51.08% male and 48.92% female patients. The majority of patients fall within the 6–20 (794) and 41–60 (695) age groups. The average LOS is longest for patients aged 60+ (2.00 days) and shortest for those aged 21–40 (1.46 days), indicating that older patients generally require longer hospital stays.

Patient turnover appears efficient, with the majority (755) staying only 1–2 days. Extended stays are rare, with only 6 patients staying 15–31 days and 4 staying more than 31 days. Departments such as Physical Medicine and Surgery report the highest numbers of inpatients, including a notable number of discharges and ICU cases, further reflecting the hospital's active inpatient management. Total revenue generated is approximately 404.49K, with consistent occupancy at 2,847 beds.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Key Takeaways:

The hospital maintains a moderate patient-to-staff ratio (0.10) and demonstrates a high positive sentiment score (95.61%) based on patient feedback.
ER waiting times are a concern, especially in OPD (94 minutes) and Gynaecology (55 minutes), signaling inefficiencies in high-load departments.
The 6–20Y age group is the most engaged and highest revenue-contributing segment (136K).
The elderly group (60+Y) reports the lowest satisfaction (4.76/5) and the longest hospital stays (2.00 days), indicating a need for more focused and tailored care.
ICU admissions (82) and death count (86) are moderate; these figures should be benchmarked against healthcare industry standards to evaluate the quality of critical care.

## Recommendations:

Reduce ER Waiting Time by optimizing workflows and redistributing resources to high-demand departments like OPD and Gynaecology.
Enhance Elderly Care with improved communication, dedicated geriatric services, and comfort-focused interventions tailored to patients aged 60 and above.
**Staff Allocation Review:** The patient-staff ratio is relatively low; consider hiring additional staff or redistributing current personnel to enhance service quality and reduce bottlenecks.
**Discharge Planning:** With only 209 discharges out of 2,506 total patients, examine discharge protocols and address potential administrative or policy-related delays.
**Leverage Positive Feedback:** Maintain and strengthen the current feedback system to drive continuous improvement in patient care and experience.
